When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-When working from two different computers, or you want an offsite backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-In case a change was made that you don't agree with.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
-Clones make a seperate local copy that is unconnected to the origin
-Forks are glones on github that reference the original
-Branches are seperate changes on a repository
-Forks when your pulling from github, clones when your pulling from local, branches when working on it

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
-Can easily compare and fix merge issues locally. Otherwise the state of the remote is unknown.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
-Collaboration without Git or Github would require lots of communication between team members to avoid conflicts.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
-Seperate branchs are useful for trying new features. Putting directly into master effects the production code.
